Pipi flies around Europe like its a huge city: goodnight Geneva, good morning Berlin, good evening for dinner in Neuchâtel! Again we are deeply impressed by our little big sister Superpips.\r\nThis time we do wall-systems to visualize scetches and first projects which will be realized at EXPO01 (Pipi Lotti changed the name from EXPO2001 to EXPO01).Pin-wall-technics. We get invited to do a Cuisine web-site.\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0328/clacalcl_th.jpg!:/files/xymedia/0000/0330/clacalcl.jpg\"target=_blank\r\n\r\nTeresa comes with Martina, a young designer from Bregenz, who we met a year ago. Martina will assist us the next months. In exchange we give her all we know about the web -> martina wants to be a web-designer (on the other side shes involved in a \"huge bar-project\":http://www.fux-mi.net\"target=_blank). After working 10 days in Neuchâtel we drive back home with Martina in her car.\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0332/slowtime.jpg!\r\n\r\nWe do some webjobs (like for \"KAUFMANN\":http://www.kaufmann-holz.at/Ref_KunstSonderbau.html\"target=_blank, the firm who sponsored NAVE\'s structure) and start to do sketches for TIMEcloud I and II. When Teresa and tOmi sit together one long, winefine night, they get the idea for TIMEclouds body: a huge cocoon.

Claude the legendary ball-collector! Claude owns a bar \"(CARGO Bar)\":http://www.cargobar.ch/\"target=_blank in Basilea, where he shows TV-documentaries from artist friends, which are travelling or living all around the world. Luks starts to work on it:short videos, only camera cuts, reflecting parts of Casqueiros life and progress.

Luks stays in Casqueiro, looking after the house, the guests, the animals, the plants, CulTV ...\r\n\r\nMartina is so much in love with the guy who runs the \"huge bar project\", that she leaves us in a hurry by plane... we can use her car to travel. We pass by Bilbao to pick up the fiberglass sticks. thats all? we thought of a big bunch, but it\'s just a little bunch, no, no that can\'t be, thats all? the whole timefish? We are stupid, and doubt. Through France on \"the old truckroute\". The hotel-chief from the James-Bond-hotel (with a bath in a glasscube the middle of the room) recommended it. And he was right: nice route!\r\n\r\nU! \"What was that?\" Teresa says. It looked like our sleep-egg, stop! We drive back: its a spacey grill- house in the shape of a biconcave lense.\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0360/franceufo.gif!\r\n\r\nWe remember that Claudius Baumann sent us photos of this lense-building after visiting NAVE.\r\n\r\nWe meet \"Martin Roth\":http://www.rothundmaerchy.com\"target=_blank in the Direcion Artistique from the EXPO01 in Neuchatel.\r\nThis last month we had a good mailwire with Martin. Sometimes it really seems to be destiny what life is webbing. Allfred (Pipis ex-second tongue) briefs us:\r\nwe shall do a virtual press conference tool for EXPO\'s next public info step -> concept, structure, design, programming. Great! We present our ideas to the whole chiefcrew 10 days later and get green light (light green..) to realize them. In the end no relevant feature shows up, it just gets a successfull infosite.\r\n\r\nWe work the first time with Kohli and Dill. Works fine! They are friends of Martin. Zürich seems newer somehow, wider.\r\n.\r\nBut now we have to go to Biella to install TIMEcloud I ! We stop in Widnau, Switzerland, where we meet marCo. We buy a digital camera.\r\nA friend of marCo works in a icehockey hall! Thats our man! He lets us build TIMEcloud there the first time. In CITTADELLARTE we won\'t have space to put the whole plastic surface, so we wanna prepare it like a tent system.\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0362/tc_widnau_th.jpg!:/files/xymedia/0000/0364/tc_widnau.jpg\"target=_blank\r\nAt four in the morning the floor seems to leave us forever: we will never be able to bring this wabbleshit into the form we want! 10 minutes later (we all lost respect for the material, because we think it never will work) TIMEcloud almost stands up by itself! WONDERFUL!\r\nWe don\'t have words for it.\r\nWe joydie.\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0366/tc_widnau2_th.jpg!:/files/xymedia/0000/0368/tc_widnau2.jpg\"target=_blank\r\n\r\nWith trust and lust we leave to Biella the next day. Martin Gepp from NOVARON comes with us. He drives us and TC\'s material to CITTADELLARTE where in 8 days the SIMPOSIO \"IL ARTE AL CENTRO\"will start. Michelangelo and Maria, the people from STALKER TEATRO and a lot more worked so hard in CITTADELLARTE! So many spaces got renovated since we were here the last time! Martin G. leaves the next morning. He will also pick us up when we will go back to Bregenz, where we open\r\n\"TcII, the 23rd of July.\":http://www.kunsthaus-bregenz.at/kubuse/timecloud/welcome.html\"target=_blank Ciao amigo Mahdiiin.. .\r\nTwo weeks living and working in CITTADELLARTE is like a dream; a long busy night.\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0370/tc1_th.jpg!:/files/xymedia/0000/0372/tc1.jpg\"target=_blank\r\n\r\n\"TcI\":http://www.kunsthaus-bregenz.at/kubuse/timecloud/tc_I/index.html\"target=_blank works well and provokes Michelangelo and our decision to do a web-space for PROGETTO ARTE together.

Another summer with the KUB around, behind and in front of us. How strange that so many people say this building gives to the arts a whole space - its so dominant!\r\n\r\nA lot of work till \"TcII\":http://www.kunsthaus-bregenz.at/kubuse/timecloud/welcome.html\"target=_blank is running, mostly for Malex, who fights with long cgi-scripts and lousy computer- systems we get \"sponsored\". But in the end the start, TcII runs better than we hoped! \"Ian Campbell\":http://www.islandnet.com/~ianc/\"target=_blank again holds the record in sending files, like last year during NAVE. Ian is the best webartist we know!\r\n\r\nWe think about a physical SWAPSPACE. A space which overswaps because of influence. Swapstruction.\r\n\r\nTeresa gets asked if she wants to do a concept for a women\'s-wineshop. She asks Evi Rüscher if she\'s interested in working together on it.\r\nThey present a concept for DIEWEIN.\r\n.\r\nWe meet Roland and Rita Jörg. Roland invites us to visit Bludenz\' new Arthouse, the REMISE. We like the space.\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0374/remise_in.jpg!\r\n\r\nIt has a clear in- and out-side. we want to work with this clear situation. this idea started to dive..\r\n\r\nWe meet marCo end of July to talk about possibilities to cover the SCHLAFHAUS. We think of what we heard of GORE\'s products, \"textiles for architecture\". We call them, we meet them next day in München, (on the ISPO - are the snow- and skatboarders the real yuppies?) we propose a sponsership deal...we will see.\r\n.\r\nWe kiss Bregenz byebye, all of you - hasta siempre. \"TcII spit well.\":http://www.kunsthaus-bregenz.at/kubuse/timecloud/index/idx_290898.html\"target=_blank We see us.\r\nLets drive through many miles.\r\nNo highways, no rush.\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0376/cubehaus.jpg!\r\n\r\nTeresa starts a tunnel-image-collection. The new digi-cam has a completly different way of \"showing light\" than an analog camera. This images seem closer to reality.\r\n\r\nBack in C - We do a little web-job for KFN products. How good to have this work too! The pure-commercial jobs always give us practice listening. To the client, his product, his wishes. All depends on the quality of the dialogue... .\r\nNow its October, still no decision from Gore\'s side. We do a winter Christo-Schlafhaus. Autumnwinds and rains and lights and visits. So many visits: now --> Martin Roth cooks Vegesoup, TV shows a documentary of Lola Flores. Calc is a cool hotel on the digiside of the sea.

What does Michelangelo think?\r\n\r\nWe need a new car - a bit newer, faster, cheaper, more comfortable. We will have to drive a lot! Driving is healthy. And driving lets time for parking. Toti! he could know something - omi calls (Totis is his Karatemaster. He works at Ford..) - he calls around-we drive together to Madrid 2 days later, \"there they sell exactly what you want\"... wow, selling cars with karaterythm. navia-madrid downtown in 255 minutes. Nobody will believe us. calc buys a turbodieselship, 100km on 7 litres, thats better than flying in heavy touristbombers.\r\n\r\nomi meets Christoph Abbrederis, the magic pencil, in Madrid. .\r\nWe should live a bit and work a bit together.

France is a strange country. The people seem to sit behind white curtains; so much empty space.\r\n\r\nWe meet Paolo Bianchi in his officelivingroom in Baden. He shows us the first concept for Linz - and books from other people he invited. N-55 from Kopenhagen looks very interesting, and Ross Sinclair from Real Life. From the others Paolo didn\'t find... he works in a book-cave...

He proposes to search with him for three experimental webprojects, he wants to run in the LAB from expo\'s site. in january 99 we will show up with a concept for WEBILD -\r\nWe build Web Bild...\r\nWe want to have this work online end of march 99!\r\n\r\nLinz - the O.K. is a huge building with a huge history.\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0398/ok_linz_th.jpg!:/files/xymedia/0000/0400/ok_linz.jpg\"target=_blank\r\n\r\nWe meet nice people in interesting spaces in there. we like the house-concept: exposing, performing as well as living, cooking, working in good studios, they even have a restaurant and a cinema downstairs. Everybody is busy, in a few days a big show opens. Linz is a surprise. So much more awake than we imagined.\r\n\r\nWe remember the SWAPSPACE-idea. A room which expresses itself... a softspace which transforms by net-inputs. the most interesting space in OK will be occupied then by another show... media...i don\'t know what...\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0404/swapspace_th.png!:/files/xymedia/0000/0402/swapspace.png\"target=_blank\r\n\r\nVienna - what happened? You got so clean and busy. We live with She. She is Vincent, the programm-director from the \"WUK\":http://www.wuk.at/\"target=_blank. what a special, nice man!\r\nWe buy wintertulips for Maria. The Pistolettos are in a good mood! Two students from Michelangelo, dressed in american military clothes eat with us (they had to dress that way to assist McCartney and Kelly to install their work in the Secession, a few days ago).\r\nMaria always cooks sooo well! Michelangelo shows us his first text for \"IL ARTE AL CENTRO \'99\".\r\n\r\nWhere this spring only TimeCloud touched down, in \'99 TENDOPOLI will be installed, a tent-village with people and contents from all around the world. The programme is incredible huge, this year 3 days, next year 2 month\'s. We decide to come to TENDOPOLI to continue the work where we stopped last time. We want to work again with TimeClouds materials, but look for a different form. Maybe a flowercocoon? Rosebudspace.\r\n\r\nMichelangelo likes the invitation from the Kunsthalle-Wien to do their a CALC - PROGETTO ARTE \"piece\"... We still don\'t know the other artists - only Bechtold - Matt seems clear. They\'ll REZ we guess...\r\nWe will wait and see how Kunsthalle will brief us... And in Biella we will work on it. We will give the Pistolettos a feedback to their programme-text and will propose maybe a friends-tent. Ciao amici!\r\n\r\nWe visit Claudia and Gernot and Lotti from PLANHAUS. We want to propose TENDOLPOLI to them! They live in a funny chaos downtown. We talk also about our work in two weeks as desti.net in Neuchâtel. We\'re looking forward to this experience. Will we like each other? Will we be able to develop the projects main part on the net? Will we find answers to the Swiss government\'s wishes?\r\n\r\nWe like the time- and artbridge-idea between Progetto Arte and calc. But Vienna\'s Kunsthalle got a bridge already! We see a groupshow from Loise Bourgeois, Jennie Holzer and Helmut Lang.\r\nWe fell in love with \"Loise.\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Bourgeois\"target=_blank\r\nThe space doesn\'t inspire us. Let\'s delete some walls. We go to buy good spanish wine for She.\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0408/caxyhome_th.jpg!:/files/xymedia/0000/0406/caxyhome.jpg\"target=_blank\r\nhomepage - august 1998  (homeology)\r\n\r\nWe stop in Bregenz again. Evi Rüscher lets us use her studio infrastructure (grafik-design). She\'s a Sweetheart! As well as her brother Alois (rüscher source - webdesign, but no own url yet - too much work...)! Alois is living the first cyberlove we know! He met Fatima in a Peru-Lima-chatroom! Now they met in New York and say they want to get married soon.\r\n\r\nWe have to do a commercial grafik-folder for the multimedia- firm (GTS) who gave us the hardware to install TimeCloud II. More than half of all our \"product-money\" exchanges happens by \"product-product\" exchange. Maybe the Nomad tools and ways-of-work also bring Nomad culture- ideals back? GTS likes the folder, thanks to Evi > all went well. \"we plug - you play\" is GTS\' new slogan.\r\nit snows, it snows.\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0410/itsnows_th.jpg!:/files/xymedia/0000/0412/itsnows.jpg\"target=_blank\r\n\r\nwe meet Silke, a student from \"Intermedia\":http://www.en.fhv.at/edu/mas/im/\"target=_blank. We met her the first time, when we did a calc-speech there. She wants to work a semester in Casqueiro. Thats a very good idea! We have to fill out a lot of papers to make it possible. Silke will start on the first of April 99. Thats a big help for us, she maybe can come with us to Linz and Biella.\r\nWe will see.\r\n\r\nWe do a little web-job for \'the toothfactory\'... they wanna redesign the whole site with calc in 99. Oh yeah, we will have a lot to do for Silke...\r\n\r\nThe day before we leave to Neuchâtel to meet the desti.net-team, MALINA is born!\r\nBettina and Martin are the happy parents!\r\nT&t are the godparents next spring!\r\n\r\nMiddle of december - way back to C starts. Still snowing. The snoworld sounds different, more bass than drum. Our new old car needs winterwheels. Artists say a lot of good byes. Good bye.\r\n\r\nNeuchâtel: we all can live in Pipis flat. Where is Pipi? Does she have her own learjet and captain yet? The desti.net-team is formed by three bobs: the a-bob - Claudia and Gernot - PLANHAUS, the ch-bob - Martin (roth comunications) and Anja Architecture, and the e-bob, which is the we-bob. We-bob arrives first, short before half ch-bob comes, finally a-bob arrives, the gypsy bob. They brought Babylotti, Grandma and all kind of extras for travelling with babys and grandmas.\r\n\r\nAnja comes the next morning. We\'re all here now! We\'ll drive to Bern for the briefing. They invited three teams more. The room is crowded, we need more chairs... We all imagined such a high-official briefing that was more professional...\r\n\r\nUnder the title Nouvelle DestiNation they want a kind of a \"dialogue-machine\", which renovates makes a link between citizens and politicians...\r\nWe sit a whole weekend together and brainstrom. Finally we decide to put \"concepts of life\" or \"life-projects\" into the middle of our proposal. We get the idea so far that we can continue online between Vienna, Navia and Zürich.\r\n\r\nOn our way back to Spain we stay in a hotel, which has the most beautiful bathroom we ever saw. Its the hotel \"Claire de lune\" in Biarritz, room 18. The Indian food in downtown Biarritz is good too.\r\n\r\nBack in C,\r\nalmost x-mas, almost new year, almost sleeping. We get a mail from Steffen and his friends - members from HERZBLUT, some \"cultureclub\" in Weimar.\r\nThey invite us to \"Bauhaus-University\":http://www.uni-weimar.de/cms/en/university/faculty-of-art-and-design.html\"target=_blank to tell them about calc, about our \"life-concept\". We will go there somewhere in spring \'99. Maybe between Linz and Biella.\r\nWhat \"life-concept\" do we have now?\r\n\r\nWe do nothing for two weeks, just playing, walking, listening to RADIO TRES, mailing a bit...\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0416/1999_th.jpg!:/files/xymedia/0000/0414/1999.jpg\"target=_blank\r\n\r\nlet time sink into now.','2008-10-30 19:39:01','2008-10-31 11:48:16'),(76,23,'casita - desti_nation - cui concept',1,3,'published','booc','The little house, we renovated together with omi\'s parents is almost finished.

Schlafhaus is still waiting. Gore tells us that they will tell us their definite decision in february... this year we must finish it!\r\n\r\nAlvaro leads all the building projects in C now. That\'s great, so we can concentrate on other plans and calc levels, and Alvaro is slowly but surely becoming a calci.\r\n\r\nLuks leaves to Basel. He wants distance and to switch off all calcbulbs for some weeks. By the way his sister Rösl and her husband Philip want to give Luks their old car. They can\'t afford it anymore in richland.\r\n\r\nWe hear that Pipi Lotti gives up the art-directors-job for EXPO-01.\r\nA pity for Switzerland, but probably the best for Pipi. We also like it, because we want to do a project together and with this decision it gets closer...\r\nMaybe in the year 2001?\r\n\r\nLisi Hämmerle, our one and only galerist shows up. She comes with her son David. Three quiet days with a lot of loud laughs. In C everybody sleeps well. Its like the atlantic ocean - at sealevel - syncronizes his brand with your alphawaves...\r\nTogether with Lisi we decide to produce art. Except she got nothing from the NAVE-skinprint. We\'d like to do a BILDING-DATA-COLLECTION. A \"piece\" you can open up in different ways. Bildings because we want to show bilder of buildings we did in c\'s-context. Maybe beginning of 2000? The Remise would be a fine place to present it. Or should we show parallel in \"Lisis Gallery\":http://www.galerie-lisihaemmerle.at/\"target=_blank?\r\n\r\nAll days working in our parts for Nouvelle DestiNation, a lot of time we spend together in chats. Distance disappears, the wire swings very well for desti.net, our idea grows fast into words and forms!\r\n\r\nA good idea for the Remise in January 2000 appears - we want to see the clear inside-outside situation of one of the art halls walls as a fountain-estuary installation. Like outside only solar panels and inside only sun. Wanna know more?\r\n\r\nAlso we are doing the concept for expo\'s LAB. Soon omi will fly to Zürich to finish the proposal for the expo-invitation, to present the LAB-idea and to meet Paolo Bianchi.\r\n\r\nNow - omi is in Zürich, Luks and Teresa in L.A, Gernot in Vienna.\r\n\r\nA desti.net delegation - Martin, Claudia, omi and sporadicly Anja - meet in Martin\'s, Balz\' and Olaf\'s flat. Together with the onliners Teresa and Gernot we finish this work in one week. Then we got a colour- and content-full folder, explaining the idea of a \"digital oracle\"... as well as dark rings under our eyes.\r\n\r\nomi and calc\'s first digital engeneer Malex meet Johannes Gees, the man responsible for \"expo\'s web- site\":http://www.expo-archive.ch/index.html\"target=_blank . expo\'s site designer Gilles Bachmann comes too. we present the concept for WEBILD (worktitle). they like it. We get green light right away! Malex can install his own Linux-server in Zürich for WEBILD. It has to be online by the end of March! Malex will come one week to L.A. in the beginning of march to do the programming with us. We will do the interface as a \"baby\" of Gilles.\r\n\r\nWEBILD - will be an online-possibility to create one image with a lot of 4x4 cm images. The only rule is: respect your image-neighbour. With the opening of the expo this image will also be printed in realspace. Have a look in expos website LAB at the end of March \'99. And play it!\r\n\r\nPaolo Bianchi visits omi in martins flat in Zürich. He tells me the news about the Linz-show. Ross Sinclair wants the big hall too, maybe we can do something as art-neighbours?\r\n\r\nomi visits Pipi Lotti\'s exhibition in Zürich - THE REMAKE OF THE WEEKEND - the show is as beautiful, as funny, as surprising. Pipi looks like a chinese dragqueen.\r\n.\r\nIt starts to snow in Zürich... while in L.A. the first roses open. After eight days omi is back in the mothership. When we wake up the next morning they cut our horizon!\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0418/horizont_th.jpg!:/files/xymedia/0000/0420/horizont.jpg\"target=_blank\r\n\r\nChainsaw-men cut all old pinetrees in front of Casqueiro. We are shocked. After two days we start to like it - much more light is reaching us now and the horizon has become wider.\r\n\r\nWorking on the \"swapspace\" for Linz and for WEBILD. For swapspace we decide to build a room, which swaps digital and analog (maybe with lenses and mirrors) the virtual and real outside in.\r\nFor WEBILD we do the fine-concept and first interface-studies.\r\n\r\nAlso for \"IL ARTE AL CENTRO 99\". We want to change the last-years metaphor of the horizontal cocoon to a vertical cocoon - an artbud.\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0424/L_K_W_th.jpg!:/files/xymedia/0000/0426/L_K_W_.png\"target=_blank\r\n\r\nhomepage - february 1998  (homeology)\r\n\r\nNow - 18th of february in L.A. - a moody sky is playing crazy between spring and Noahs arks set off.

A present for Loop, the calc-dog. The new dogs name is Camela, shes only three months old, Loop likes her, the cats don\'t.

Manolo Pasodoble tells us about a mysterious hot waterbulb, which traveled from the gulf of mexico to the cantabrian coast... a proposito!:\r\nPeter Lütje and Maike are arriving! when Esther and Steffen left. we met Peter when he was one of the A.i.R. in citta\', Meike we only knew from what he told us (\"my wife is doing a lightning-career, while I resi-dance!\"). they are married and run \"rraum in Frankfurt\":http://www.rraum.de/\"target=_blank. a space, this or that space, in their apartment, which they give to people for a while, so they can inform the room. we are happy to be invited to rraum too!.\r\n\r\nduring their stay in Casqueiro we also work on some new KFN-updates. Peter names the developing KFN baby : BIMO - the BIMObile-system.\r\n\r\none night, mild, long night with deep basstones weaving round casqueiro, it started that we open rraum III in . in \"Navia York\", like Peter said. like a glow-worm, parked in space among us, this idea became more and more... an idea.\r\nwe imagine a public space within the social daily-structure, which opens periodically its real space with new works (all kind of works..) in Navia, and announce it (by web and mailings and print and all) as if it would be in Navia York. kind of the same question like in the hole calc-thing is interesting: can this \"kind of gallery\" be successful in the sense of influence and thereby change daily life, or not?\r\n\r\nis it a good idea to open a \"modern art gallery\" (for a period of a year we said..) in a village where it seems that no nose has any interest in it? how can we know if we don\'t try? can we know if we don\'t? no.\r\n\r\nso - ... rrrauuummmm! Maike said probably after their last year in Städelschule in 2001. we have it fat written in our count-down-agenda!\r\n\r\nand all visits go, Olivier Feraud, another A.i.R. and his friend Elise come just a half day and a night and a morning,... and where are we? oh yes, at home, at the coast, living on level zero, with a hot waterbubble swinging in front of our housebeach!\r\n\r\ngood! Mister Bedia, Navias mayor, gives us the inofficial okay to help us in further \"parksteps\". he\'ll participate with machines and workers which will help us very soon with first big step: to break down the wall to the height of a bench, and clean up the canel and the field.\r\n\r\nwe want to inaugurate the 2nd of September, dia de San Antolín! no time left! but first the \"park-issue\" must be accepted by the town-representatives, so we only got 5 short days, when they start the 26 of August...\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0468/park_th.png!:/files/xymedia/0000/0470/park.png\"target=_blank\r\n\r\nlets see, but anyhow - we print the invitations and invite!\r\n\r\nwe want music and Sidra, lights and oranges! we do what we can, Alvaro too, who will live soon right next to el Parque del Naranjo.\r\n\r\neclipse totale! we are in the 80% shadowfield and find the strange sunglasseffect nice.but seagulls laugh as ever and the dogs do not even look up... all we hear from people who have been in the 100%field is unbelievable!\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0472/eclipse_big.jpg!\r\n\r\nTeresa and Silke were in \"L.A.\":http://www.ok-centrum.at/carteblanche/park/la/11-08-99.html\"target=_blank when it happened.\r\n\r\nnow we will finance the buying of the land with the money we made with communimage. \"Lisi Hämmerle\":http://www.galerie-lisihaemmerle.at/\"target=_blank wants to do an orange- party in her gallery specially for potential buyers of the O-images we did... we hope it works, at least that we can pay the expenses (~1.300.000 Pesetas, and the town pays the rest...). art is to gamble seriously.\r\n\r\nafter that, end of August 99, Lisi H. wants to take \"us\" and the O-park-project to the FIAC in Paris...\"new tendecies\" or something like that...the dimensions of the \"market-box\" she got there is boring and ugly! we don\'t know what to do there...difficult...we make a model... and an invitation card.\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0474/postal_th.jpg!:/files/xymedia/0000/0476/postal_big.jpg\"target=_blank\r\n\r\nLuks is working a lot on the proposal he was asked for by Michelangelo Pistoletto for Cittadellarte\'s communication: to develop a maillist-sytem which garantees a continous information about citta\'s activities and plans.

Tal brought just small versions of it, the \"original\" big ones are still in Jerusalem. where could they be presented?\r\n\r\n.\r\nTal brings also the recorded sound of the cystern in Jerusalem\'s old city, which we maybe want to play together with the model of \"Mamila pool\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamilla\"target=_blank. the sound of drops, few drops, no rhythm - surprise/chaos, which fall from high into a huge underground pool. we heard this together when Tal showed us this cystern in december. but we saw nothing, we just heard the space.\r\nthe disk and the ring from DROPone don\'t arrive, problems with the border control. they might have got stuck by controlling the control of the control.\r\n\r\nPeter Lütje and Stefan Potengovsky working already in the Tendopoli informatica - their \"tents\". down there is an image - the coloured .drunk-platon-tent is Peter\'s, theres only a little radio hanging inside. the round one behind is Stefans, he covered it now with a special kind of shimmering silk. behind you see DROPone as we installed it some weeks later, when we returned from Bregenz\' opening.\r\n\r\n!/files/xymedia/0000/0632/th_peter_bucki.jpg!:/files/xymedia/0000/0634/peter_bucki.jpg\"target=_blank\r\n\r\nwe are installing together with Tal his collectors item ...

Bolzano?\r\n\r\ndidn\'t we mention it? Marion Daminai called us some weeks/months? ago and told us about a very interesting sounding project in Bolzano. they are planning there a new part of the university, scientific faculties, and they develop the \"art\" for the \"sciencehouse\" already from zero between the architects and the artists. they can imagine that calc and M.P. do another colaboration for a \"mediaspace\". we called Michelangelo then and decided that we accept the invitation if they officially will invite us. this happened some days/weeks later when Erik Steinbrecher mailed. he will cordinate/curate a show in ar/ge kunst gallery - Bolzano. we are invited to \"give an idea\" what our work in the university will/could be. but we really can\'t know/think now. we just know that we want to work with telematic tools and programs to open a specific \"netspace\". a knot in the net. we sit on cittadellartes afternoon sun-shadow-border and have the idea to work with one of Michelangelos minus objects (painting for meeting). we imagine to install it right on the glassborder/streetwindow of the gallery, so one half would be out, one in. the reflecting glass between the two who sit in the wooden frame, would not only overlay the two, but also making a conversation impossible. we draw several \"lines\" between the two, to clear this acoustic hurdle. then we find the oldest system we know: the yohgurt beaker telephone! we like that! it could be a good start for this project. yes, we will propose that to Erik soon.\r\n.\r\nooops, we almost forgot: we have to send our proposal for AUA EXTREMA, a project that east-switzerland does for the EXPO.02. we got invited to share a competition. its all about water...a jury will select who go into the second round, in the end 8 will be realized - travelling \"sculptures\" who shall provoke interest and discussion for what they are presenting 2002 in Biel. when we still were in Casqueiro and sat with Curt together he came up with the idea to do a huge spirit level. now we imagined with Teresa and Tal that we enlarge the idea with sound, who comes from the bubble-splash, because the spirit level has to be installed on soft tilting grounds, and with a conected website, who reflects the journey of the spirit levels and the \"levels\" of the place where it is now. fast concept, borderpeople get happy, a package for switzerland is coming.\r\nauadraw\r\nokay, we have to pack, Casqueiro is waiting! we are back in about a month and a half, hasta pronto amigos!\r\n\r\nlets drive along the cote d\'azur...lets take time for the trip.

Tal started to do a telematic collectors item. a kind of diary he sends every week or more by mail to friends. reports from the ownroad. 4 days we need, or five?, we stay again in too-much-Menton, and in some other places, Teresa still is a bit sick, still not smoking, we send the proposal to Erik - the yoghurt-line...','2008-10-31 20:59:35','2008-10-31 21:01:18'),(90,2,'2001',12,2,'published','',NULL,'2008-11-01 16:13:37','2008-11-01 16:13:37'),(91,2,'2002',13,2,'published','',NULL,'2008-11-01 16:13:49','2008-11-01 16:13:49'),(92,2,'2003',14,2,'published','',NULL,'2008-11-01 16:13:54','2008-11-01 16:13:54'),(93,2,'2004',15,2,'published','',NULL,'2008-11-01 16:14:02','2008-11-01 16:14:02'),(94,2,'2005',16,2,'published','',NULL,'2008-11-01 16:14:07','2008-11-01 16:14:07'),(95,2,'2006',17,2,'published','',NULL,'2008-11-01 16:14:10','2008-11-01 16:14:10'),(96,2,'2007',18,2,'published','','','2008-11-01 16:14:16','2008-11-01 16:15:40'),(97,2,'2008',19,2,'published','',NULL,'2008-11-01 16:14:20','2008-11-01 16:14:20'),(98,96,'calcbooc 3.0',1,3,'published','booc','	\r\n\r\n\"(homeology)\":/projects/homeology/index.html\"target=_blank\r\n\r\n..planed it but never did it > the condividual c a l c b o o c 3.0.\r\n\r\nuntil now it was more hypo then hyper, wasn’t it?\r\nhypo also made it stand like rooted in the web since\r\nthe last page..18 months ago! but now, uffffinally,\r\nwe’d like to announce that this b o o c, (y)our c-book,\r\nbecomes a real dialogical hyperbooc!\r\n\r\n..technically that what we call a blog today .. a 2.0 tool.\r\nbut the fact that we started our blog before the blogs but\r\nthen never found the time to give it also the blog features\r\nmade that we skip now* directly to a 3.0 blog, the b o o c 3.0.\r\n\r\nas you might have read between a lot of lines the b o o c\r\nwas always meant as a kind of poetical or ”intimate copyleft\r\ndiary”.. as a copy left for you, with the wish that you might\r\nwant to feedback, redraw, contradict, co_propose, .., or just\r\nlist, link and loop. as a ping which increases the pongability.\r\n\r\nbut the fact that it didn’t contain any blog feature doesn’t\r\nmean that it didn’t work. the question who this you is, a you\r\nwho is not abstract but known to us or one of us, made\r\nit just more working outside the screens. we like to imagine\r\nthat this physical relational element of ”being the net” is also\r\nwhat makes the b o o c 3.0 in its next version.\r\n\r\nopen for everyone to see, listen and read, but only 100%\r\npongable within the b o o c for those yous who are mentioned,\r\nthe people which are meant with their names, and the people\r\nwhich are mentioned by these people in their pongs…\r\n\r\n..you\'ll receive a mail when the n e w b o o c is on_____!\r\n\r\n*now? we are checking and changing ideas how and with\r\nwhich tools we want to b o o c on. how we can make that\r\nedited text can send easily mails and direct links to those\r\nwho are mentioned, and how the “degrees of yous” (personal\r\nknown you, a new you introduced by a mentioned you, a you\r\njust found/read in a book, etc.) can be defined and structurally\r\nbe managed. we suppose that needs another month or two.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime see the projects behind the new icons,\r\nor ongoing works like in geografia affettiva or L-able..\r\nor just click back into the widths of booc.01 >\r\n\r\nboocicon\r\n\r\nc you supersoon, your calcies..','2008-11-01 16:16:20','2008-11-03 12:27:17'),(100,94,'san antolin nº7, archiweb, el tinglao, l-able',1,3,'published','booc','back in Navia...

As I mentioned, the gallery we were going to exhibit \"Social Construction\" in closed. However, my co-curator, Abner Nolan, found a new venue which is much larger and better. The institution is called \"Southern Exposure\" and is one of the best respected and well-attended art institutions in the city. We have confirmed our show which will open on May 13, 2005 and close June 18. I would like to ask if you would still be willing to show your work? We have a slightly better budget, so we can offer a US$200 honorarium for your team. We should also be able to cover the printing costs. Finally, since the space is so large, I think we will be able to exhibit the work at the original size you specified - approximately 10m x 10m. Can you also send me a brief, one paragraph description of the work, and how you would like the work attributed - the precise language describing the creators of the work. After you agree, I will pass you off to the Gallery Manager, Kristen Evangelista, who will serve as your main contact. She\'ll send you an official invitation letter and more details about the show.\r\nI\'ve attached an image of the gallery and gallery plan. The wall we think is best is the 33\'2\" wall that is a vertical wall in the center of the plan. In the photograph, it\'s the wall to the left, which is a bit obscured in the photo.

Él iba con poco viento de aleta, contento y a unos cuatro nudillos, para recorrer, por una mar tranquila, doscientas cincuenta millas y poder llegar con luz de día al pequeño arrecife (merece la pena buscarla en una carta). Salió solito, porque a los dos barcos italianos aún les faltaba mucho para tener sus barcos a punto.\r\nDesde hace varios días la vida a bordo gira alrededor de la recepción de información meteorológica; a tres horas distintas del día suena un inconfundible cric, cric, cric, de la entrada de los weather fax de \"situación actual\", \"a treinta horas\" y \"a cuarenta y ocho\"; al atardecer nos enganchamos a la red, recibimos varias previsiones meteorológicas y además despierta expectación por si nos trae algunos correos personales, ¿para ti? ¿para mí?\r\nMuchos besos,\r\nEl Sur\r\n\r\n..already some days after a next report from Polynesia..from Minerva Norte, its going towards New Zealand..will eVa and omi meet them in New Zealand end of winter..?\r\n\r\neVa’s back from Cap Canaveral! ..she brought hundreds of images, measurements..drawings..\r\nand a lot to tell from her talks with Slyvie and Yannick.. on the long run the terrace-project is\r\na whole-house- project...you’ll soonsee..we’ll present ideas and first plans end of feb.2005..\r\n\r\n> 24th OF NOV > surprise surprise!

Después de casi siete meses de vagabundeo náutico por los Mares del Sur y sus islas, se disponen a abandonar las latitudes tropicales para dirigirse a Nueva Zelanda, ya al sur del Trópico de Capricornio. Al parecer lo hacen en Vava\'u, que en línea recta está a unas 2.200 millas de Las Marquesas, y a 1.150 de Auckland, al norte de Nueva Zelanda.\r\nAdjunto mapita y, para más ilustración, unas notitas sobre Tonga: El Reino de Tonga, la última monarquía en Oceanía, es un pequeño país ubicado al este de Australia y al noreste de Nueva Zelanda, al sur del Océano Pacífico. El archipiélago decidió unificarse en una monarquía polinesia en 1845 y 55 años después se convirtió en un protectorado británico.

Los romeros, vestidos a la usanza, y con la música de sus motores, se acercaban en los dingys y desembarcaron en la playa; allí una tríada de autoridades daba la bienvenida, portando luces (solares de jardín); a la derecha figuraba la primera dama romera con el traje de faralaes y su flor al pelo; en el centro, un personaje, ataviado con tricornio y capa de tuno, espíritu mixto de Franco y el Duque de Ahumada, lanzó un discurso y con una voz trémula y una mano tonta que subía y bajaba, decía: \"Españoles, habéis recorrido muchos mares para participar en esta romería con la \"virggen\" de Tapana.......; pronto se yuxtapuso el espíritu de Ahumana, se fue calentando y empezó a querer atizar a los congregados. Después, los romeros, presididos por las autoridades, muy devotos todos, acompañaron a la \"roja paloma\" e hicieron el recorrido desde la playa, subiendo las escalerillas hasta el restaurante, con cánticos de sevillanas mal recordadas, algún \"porón pon pero\" y alternado con algún que otro bailecito aprendidos por algunas por la mañana ¡Viva la roja paloma! ¡Viva la virgen de Tapana!.\r\n\r\nUna vez arriba, entre el baile y el mal cante brindamos con el último \"Beronia\" navegado desde España y degustamos las ricas viandas preparadas por las tripulaciones de los cuatro barcos españoles (Calcetines, Cormorán, Aldo y Sur) y uno italiano (Maistracc). ¡Toda una fiesta en el Pacífico, a la usanza de la lejana tierra patria!\r\n\r\nComo veis, os tenemos en el corazón.

portantes a una velocidad media de 24,64 nudos, hemos conseguido un 6º puesto en esta 7ª etapa con nuestro barco VskTugas I, con lo cual aumentamos nuestra ventaja en la clasificación general hasta los 92 puntos con respecto al 2º clasificado.\r\nLa derrota nos llevó primero a costear Terranova adentrándonos en el Atlántico para dejar las Hebridas por estribor, pasar entre el norte de Escocia y las Orcadas y de ahí librando la punta sur de la península Escandinava ir a cruzar la meta enfrente de Oslo.\r\n\r\nLa clasificación, en sus primeros puestos, queda como sigue:\r\n1º VskTugas I.................1.954 puntos\r\n2º Akakino....................1.862 \"\r\n3º VIRTUALROUTER Team.........1.772 \"\r\n4º Ptitporsail................1.666 \"\r\n5º azra.......................1.630

Nuestra actuación en esta etapa ha sido más bien discreta ( no sé si por influencia del \"triangulo de las Bermudas\") pero el caso es que en el paso del primer WP quedamos cortos de barlovento y solo conseguimos remontarlo en la posición 40ª y ciertamente descolgados de la cabeza de la flota, a partir de ahí nada que objetar al resto de nuestra regata, al 2º WP llegamos alrededor de la posición 30ª y entramos en meta al fin en la posición 28ª.

MANA V.A. wants us to do the architecture (mainly one interior, a laboratory of a molecular-biologist) and some screen design and animations (from this scientists work), but we can\'t. we have to be straight now. not more than we know what we can do good. we propose Ricardo and Valerie (MIRSANMIR) to do that job! they meet, they check, the like, they will do it. thats fine, so we can share the proccess at least from the edge...they\'ll start right after doing their BIG job, in a month or so. will be reported on this pages later on.\r\n\r\na spanish lady calls \"do you also do design for mushrooms?\" \"excuse me, what please??\", \"well i heard from a friend that you are serious and good designers\". \"thank you, but what has this to do with mushrooms?\", \"you know i am just starting to cultivate food mushrooms and i wanted to ask you if you could do the whole campaign for it, you know everything, the logo, the web....\" the same day calc gets an invitation for doing a \"piece\" in England; but they like this mushrooms more than those \"pieces\". but anyway they can\'t do it - omi asks MIRSANMIR again....\"sure, great, lets meet them\" Richard says.\r\n\r\nin the meantime omi\'s parents Märle and Curt arrived! they are happy about the progress of the Cabanon. they start right away to set up all things they brought, lights, tools, Curts colors, their laptop...

Luks and Richard will stay in Casqueiro, they\'ll work on new calcaxy and some jobs we urgently have to do - the fridge is growing thin again.\r\n\r\n11-09-2000 - sky is closed and gray. art is a windmashine for blue holes.\r\n\r\n26-12-2000\r\ngood evening.\r\n\r\nLuks and Ricardo don\'t have time...\r\nthey mainly work on STUDIO2, some updates for YHEPPA and on the new infrasturcture plans for the Lab.\r\nwill spring 2001, when the YEARoff starts to lighten up, bring calcaxy.03?\r\n\r\n28_12_2000 - outside the warm, quiet lab, there\'s the moody sky again, shaking the world, changing quickly from bigblue to darkgrey light. x-mas time on the lazecoast. the barometer is drawing an extreme valley-mountain curve since weeks. the wind surfs us.\r\n\r\nkaufmann_kaufmann.com still isn\'t done.\r\nwhere men build house men also build trouble - but we just heared they\'ll be solved before the milleniumshift. but FRED won a design prize, so we\'ll make a simple webfanzine for the 12th of january, when this prize will be presented to K_K. and later on we\'ll do the w-site...\r\n\r\ntimebackmemoryloop: middle of september, T + o leave to Bolzano. this time just an idea on board, they\'ll realise all in the AR/GE Kunst gallery there...we had a lot of time to talk about and to imagine the web-sandbox.\r\n\r\none week later, 1600miles away from mothership it\'s. done - light on sand. the first real meeting with Erik Steinbrecher, the \"curator\" and pARTizipater and Judith, the nicest gallerist of all, ist good! Erik will curate the whole university-(p)art. we also can meet the architects, Bischof & Azzola from Zürich. Erik shows us the huge hole in the middle of Bolzano, where the uni is gonna be build. we have time to think and to experiment what we will install there. faculty of design, space in between, students. 2004 should be the opening. we agree to present a next step of \"sandbox\"after we have talked to Michelangelo, soon.\r\nsandbox\r\n','2008-11-03 11:54:08','2008-11-03 11:54:51'),(206,24,'SPACEplace , -BIG torino ?',11,3,'published','booc','T & o go to Bregenz at the end of september. to de-install spacePLACE, to visit famely\'n friends and to think about what to propose and do in UNIDEE, where they\'ll go after a trip to the \"famous Zumthor-bath\" in Vals, Switzerland.\r\n\r\nMadin and Beetli invite them to come. Madin is Beetlis boyfriend and Beetl omis cousin....what a valley, what a village! the bath is much better than the homepage promised, but not as good as so many people toled us. not at all. the water is great, entering water is like entering a feeling. but why do all newbuild elements have these radical angular and rough shapes and make the feeling harder as the water asks for? you can take your life while relaxing on one of the borders of the bath\'s and cut your neck.\r\ndoesn\'t water ask for round shapes, soft corners? or does Zumthor want that the water makes softshapes with time (almost everything made out of slate)? lets come back in 200 years. well, the hotel is funny, sometimes even pretty, expansive...we reservated a room which was \"renovated by the architect\": like sleeping in a design museumshop - table from Grey, chair from van der Rohe, bed by Zumthor... but everything is okay after we have the first meal. they know how to cook here! 3 days chilling out in rosebud water in the foggy valley of Vals. the moody russian waitress transforms the ambient in a kind of postsovietic science fiction. but the best architecture we saw was a little chapel in the last curve before leaving the village..\r\nvals_chapel\r\ncyberhelvetia.ch - still secret, still evolving in a closed circuit will be a parallel project while we will work in UNIDEE. and AETHER3 - the project from Penelope Wehrli, you remember? Penelope invited us and 9 more (like Kyong Park from Detroit, Milla Zoufall from Berlin, N55 from Kopenhagen or Stefan Muenker from Berlin too...) to talk on the phone about questions like \"for what would we fighting for?\", \"do we have \'utopias\'?\". these talks will be \"shown\" in Munich in an ex atom reactor somewhen in january 2001.\r\nthe cyberhelvetia.ch (cybe) our job is dealing with the question how to present cybe in real life within the swiss expo.02 ex- hibitions, which will open spring 2002. with martin, one of the bosses of belleville, who is behind the cybeproject, we agree to have weekly mail-, chat- and telephone sessions. every week we will give feedbacks and inputs in order to find ideas and a first concept till end of october. Luks and Ricardo will partizipate the process from Spain.\r\n\r\narriving in cittadellarte, first week of october. incredible rain storms the night before, when we stoped in a small town near the lago maggiore. heavy showers sounds like big fire. when we arrive Tal, Steffen, Biju, Yoav and Esther are playing volley in citta\'s yard. a strange sceleton hangs on a rope which is crossing the whole yard. Lyn, another Zero, is here since a month. the following month will last a year! so many people, questions, reasons for parties! the \"cooperation\" with Tal Adler ended quick. too much things and speculations between us. check out his collectors item #52!\r\n\r\noctober in headlines: fresh chaos and order, \"the university of ideas\" is born, but only few people seem to realise it. opening of Eytan Shoukers PENPAL project, and son\'s & fathers within the context of THE BORDER. every week working on cybe too, Benoit Roussel runs a \"cinè club\", every wendsday in the performance space.\r\n\r\n[Alberto from Veracruz-Mexico writes an e-mail. he saw communimage in Mexico ciudad and liked it. now he wants to write an article about the project in a fanzine he\'s doing there. Johannes sends him two posters from the new years image we did almost a year ago.]\r\n\r\nwe present to Michelangelo the idea to make a kind of magazine for UNIDEE, he likes it, we start right away. the same work (files) we can use later on to do the web site. the magazine wants to be radically visual, images and URL\'s. probably just on CD and mainly for the a.i.r (artists in residence) - like a very visual adressbook....\r\nMichelangelo will do the next artistic direction of BIG TORINO 2002 (page from 2000) the bienal of Turin! he asks us if we want to work with him for the concept and...yes, sounds very interesting, but we have to talk to Luks first...\r\n\r\nend of october - revolution - two days where everybody puts everything on the table in UNIDEE. but the table stays almost empty - evolution. Teresa and omi stay some more days, after all a.i.r. and zeros left, to talk with Michelangelo about next year. mainly about how we can conect the exhibitions more to the contents of UNIDEE. this year it was like a contradiction: to invite for \"heterodox art\", but presenting \"orthodox art\". we\'ll work out a proposal when we all are back home in mothership... now we talk about our last subject for this time: the piece for Bolzano. together with Michelangelo Teresa and omi talk and imagine about a window, which can change position and view, attitude and content. we will continue the talk by e-mail and telephone, its geting late - ciao amici, ciao, we stay in contact...\r\n\r\nbut now >> fast forward > nevertheless T & o need a week for the 1500 miles. time gets slower, but seems faster, when you are tired and travelling.\r\n\r\n','2008-11-03 11:55:42','2008-11-03 11:56:15'),(207,24,'richard, johannes, asacuna, big business',12,3,'published','booc','back on the green coast! some days of just breathing and walking, sleeping...first of all we do the new UNIDEE-site. studio2 was growing well!

Casqueiro looks better then ever!\r\nRicardo does the presentation concept for the \"spirit level\". in cittadellarte we met Mark Bain - the fantastic soundman! we asked him if he could help us to do the technical sound part of the piece. Mark didn\'t see any problem and sends us a plan, which is based on hydrophones. some days later, after Curt sends the construction plans he made with a swiss artist blacksmith, we send the plans to AUA EXTREMA -> sorry just deutsch. would be great if they want to realise our idea - the money we could put directly into the progress of studio2!\r\n\r\nRicardo made a streetsign for the park for L.A.\r\n\r\nthats good - a little step to make clearer that we got a playground in our center. next year we definitly want to continue the parkwork - some benches, a fireplace, a projection-wall, water, light...\r\n\r\nwe are working on the second step for the new universitiy in Bolzano...impossible to imagine something real, because we still can\'t do the model of the space - the architects are still moving walls and changing details...but we write a basic concept which clearly shows the direction of our installation - working title: r e a l i t y v e r s u s l i f e . university is \"reality\", outside the windows and doors is \"life\" and in between is our piece. a bridgepiece again, versuspiece...our first project with time and a real budget (60.000.000 Lire), 2004 it should be done - and: start!\r\n\r\nyippiiii - they selected the spirit level to be realised!\r\n\r\nwe get a phonecall from Javier, a profesor in Bilbaos faculdad de bellas artes.

Penelope and Kyra choose in this 4th and last round who talks to whom - omi talks again with Stefan Muenker from Berlin. thats perfect, he would have chosen also him...again a pleasure to listen and talk to Stefan. we talk about god and dog, world and ownworld, how we can imagine that good ideas or projects can reach more stupidity and drowsiness of people. from the subject to the project (Villem Flusser). we agree that we need a fresh and full portion of humility. omi decides what Mila Zoufall proposes in another talk - to avoid the term ARBEIT (work). horrible word! and used in such senses that it doesn\'t make sense anymore. but how else can we call it? SPIELEN (play)? sounds much too FUN, too american way of can...SCHAFFEN (create)? too pathetic? anyway - but this could heal a bit: to recognize that every desiccion is a \"creative act\" and therefore we are humans and re-spons-ible. we are dialogical animals learning to express and impress, all life long. what else? work becomes network (Benoit Roussel).\r\n\r\nRichard Jochum lets us know that dis-positiv worked well in Bregenz, he\'ll send us some of the magazine he did in addition.\r\n\r\nJohannes calls.. he tells us from a new project he wants to do during the world economic forum in Davos and asks us if we want to join - do the interface. yes! the project is called HELLO MR.
