      <div class="body">how it came that there was less time than ever to upbooc these screens? like there was no second around the whole year.. just liquid moments floating one into each other not leaving not even a thought of sitting down and typing.. sorry to all the people who came here and never found anything fresh.

two women changed lives, the live of this booc and the c a l c life radically: LOLA and PAM.. their being and love made time so liquid and the usual almost unrecognizable. LOLA swashed into Miss Pi’s and Topos live (their baby!), PAM into omis.. like a dream stepping from future and memories into a shared presence, where all was restarted.
LOLA was real-born the others were like reborn.. hold to refeel, rethink and redefine some frames and ways things went so far. and a lot changed.. again, but never so much in such a flowgo.

LOLA was real-born the others were like reborn.. hold to refeel, rethink and redefine some frames and ways things went so far. and a lot changed.. again, but never so much in such a flowgo.
..and there was a mysterious auto-delete-happening which made the booc-folder disappear..and with it all our notes, mails, …so, whenever you are reading > (inboxbooc) know that the linked text or image is gone into the blind black of the hardisknirvana. so how to go on with the booc, now that everything feels new and c a l c looks more like a bunch of babies than an old experienced whale? we decided to write this fattest and fullest of all chapter-times in a kind of telegram-way.. to not forget our own art history and to bring an idea to an end, or a new start.

we’ll take spime (space and time as one liquid..) and we’ll see what presence, the crossing of moments and qualities will suggest.. and will let u know.. until then we just will go on to update c a l c a x y with new little icons and links towards the new projects we are doing bringing on their way..</div>
